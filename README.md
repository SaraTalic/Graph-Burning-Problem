# Project: Graph Burning Problem

## Overview

This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course and focuses on solving the **Graph Burning** problem. Two different solutions have been proposed for addressing this problem:

1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Solving the problem using a greedy approach.
2. **Hybrid Model**: Generating 50 burning sequences using the greedy algorithm, with the initial steps being used in the PULP solver to obtain an optimal solution.

## Technologies

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for implementing and testing the algorithms.
- **Python**: The main programming language for the implementation.
- **PULP Solver**: Optimization using the PULP solver.

## Features

- **Greedy Algorithm**: Implemented for graph burning.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Integrating the greedy algorithm with the PULP solver for optimization.
- **Graph Analysis**: Exploring graph structures and burning sequences.
